        <em>
          This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which we collect, use,
          maintain, and disclose information collected from users (each, a
          "User") of our website (the "Site") and any related services offered
          by us. This privacy policy applies to the Site and all products and
          services offered by us.
        </em>

        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

          identification information, though that may prevent them from engaging
          in certain Site-related activities.
        </p>

        <h2>Non-personal identification information</h2>

        <p>
          We may collect non-personal identification information about Users

        <h2>Web browser cookies</h2>

        <p>
          Our Site may use "cookies" to enhance the User experience. Users' web
          browsers place cookies on their hard drive for record-keeping purposes
